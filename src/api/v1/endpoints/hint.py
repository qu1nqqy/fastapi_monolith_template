"""
Define FastAPI route handlers for versioned API endpoints.

- Split routers by domain (user, training, auth, etc).
- Avoid business logic here â€” delegate to service/repository layers.
- Use Pydantic models for request/response.

Group endpoints inside routers and include them in the central API router.
